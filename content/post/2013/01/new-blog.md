This is the place of my new blog, moving away from Wordpress, and moving to [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/).
Pelican is a static site generator written in Python which enables serving a site directly from Github.

Pelican makes writing a post as easy as pushing a file to Github.
So writing has become more like programming, which increases the chances of me blogging more often ;)
